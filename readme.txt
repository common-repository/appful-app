WordPress App Builder: what problem do we solve?
As soon as publisher decide on setting up a mobile app, they face the choice between monotonous low-quality “mobile app builders” lacking the opportunity to create custom designs, because they will never have a chance against mobile apps from professional mobile app agencies. However, agencies and freelancer are slow, changes can be implemented only by the developer and are tremendously expensive. We are a solution to this problem.

**About Appful - Turn WordPress into Native App**

8 years ago, one of our founding members ran a company and was desperately looking for somebody that would develop him a mobile app for his blog. For the same reasons mentioned above, he insisted on trying a mobile app in the form of an iOS and android app because he was sure that a mobile app makes a huge difference in comparison to browsers. At first, he did not find anybody who was able to develop his mobile app as an android app until he found the developer of our current team. We developed the mobile app together and it had tremendous success. We were so proud of our work and discovered a whole new world and everything that was possible in it – the world of mobile apps. What started as a little idea soon became a passion. We planned to build a company that provides the tools for bloggers to do the same. Appful has been in development for almost one decade now and we are now very close friends. The love to mobile apps for iOS and android and our passion is what keeps the company running. The times when you have to go to an agency and pay thousands of dollars to get a middle-class looking mobile app for iOS and android are over. We provide you with a very affordable, stunning app for android and iOS that can easily keep up with competitors – more over, your chances are good to get a very successful mobile app. We only take little fees to keep your app updated and running. Our mobile app company is now based in Germany and has a great success. We are very proud of what we already accomplished and looking forward to seeing what is going to follow.

**Differences between mobile apps and mobile sites**

Did you know that we spend more than 80% in native mobile apps when we use our android and iOS devices? As a result, less than 20% of our smartphone use time is spent in browsers where people read your blog, and the trend is growing towards a mobile app.
In every area of our lives, we recognize the trend to mobiles devices and smartphones. Mobile Devices (Android Apps and iOS Apps) are everywhere, and they are talking over task by task. We use a mobile app for communication, a mobile app for entertainment, a mobile app for booking, a mobile app for eating, a mobile app photos, a mobile app for meeting new people and especially a mobile app for getting information and news on both android and ios. A mobile app accommodate many functions: they can provide general info, contact prices, reserve forms, search engines, utilizer accounts, heralds, news victuals, events, special deals and even more. Thanks to push notifications, you can get even more proximate and directly interact from your mobile app to your client. Make it facile for your readers or customers to contact you – your mobile app plugin will avail you to build better customer cognitions. Having a mobile app for is still quite recherché, this can give you a leap to advance against your competition. Mobile App vs. mobile Web App vs. mobile site.


**Appful for Publishers**

If you are a publisher with a large audience and do not have a mobile app yet, your readers have no possibility to be up-to-date with your news. Only through a native mobile app, you can unfiltered reach your target group through push notifications. In addition to that, a native mobile app creates a whole different feeling when using it. It can use the core advantages of native software and access powerful frameworks and offer tremendous features.
Since you are on our page, chances are that you have already tried out different mobile app builder solutions. You may have also noticed that a vast majority of mobile app builders are complex to use, look unprofessional and unclean and are very limited in both function and design. Furthermore, they are very expensive and often require a developer account that also costs more than 320$/year. On top of that, they limit push notifications for your mobile app.
We are bloggers ourselves and also discovered these issues when trying to create a mobile app. You can either use an overpriced mobile app builder or offer a professional agency that takes very long and is very expensive as well.
So we thought there has to be a better way, and we invented appful – the golden mean between mobile app builders and agencies for an android app and an iOS app. We offer a strong background system, take care of the whole process of publishing, managing and updating your mobile app for iOS and android and offer affordable prices. Furthermore, we enable you to better monetize your mobile app for android and iOS and earn more money. We do not limit push notifications. Once set up, you never have to worry about your mobile app again. Push notifications are sent completely automatically – no action required. In our strong analytics system, you can watch your mobile app growing.
The best thing is that we want you to be happy with your app, so we decided not to charge any money until you are 100% satisfied and decide to release your mobile app for ios to the app store and your android app to the play store. You can try and experiment with every function and design your mobile app as long as you like for free and test your android app and iOS app on your devices.
Once you are content with your mobile app, you can hand it over to us, and we will take care of the remaining process. We will hand your iOS App over to Apple and your Android App to Google and offer strong servers that process the content of your mobile app. Your site does not have to struggle with an extra amount of traffic.
